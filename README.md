A small application built with .net 8.0 that spins up a minimal api, a worker service and a blazor wasm frontend.
The application has basicly no security implemented, so use at your own risk. 


The app is a discordbot that can be controlled via a web page that connects to a exposed api.
Would require some setup for the ip addresses in project to make it actually connect properly.

Might update this in the future, as this is still quite scuffed with no security implemented and I don't think I actually need the worker service.
