A small application built with .net 8.0 that spins up a minimal api, a worker service and a blazor wasm frontend.
The application has basicly not security implemented to use at your own risk. 


The app is discordbot that can be controlled via the frontend ui via a exposed api. Would require some setup to setup the ip addresses in each part to make it actually connect properly.
